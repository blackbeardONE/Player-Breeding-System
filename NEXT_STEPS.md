# Player Breeding System - Next Steps

## 1. Data Collection Integration
- Develop REST API endpoints using FastAPI to collect player stats, achievements, financial data, and behavior from game engines (Unity/Unreal).
- Implement secure and efficient data ingestion pipelines.
- Store collected data in the MariaDB central data hub.

## 2. Inter-Agent Communication
- Design and implement APIs or message queues for AI agents to exchange data and coordinate.
- Implement Blade AI routing logic to forward data to genre-specific agents (Claire, Earnest, Sophie).
- Enable Mao AI and Ioana AI to consume aggregated data for behavior analysis and quest design.

## 3. AI Model Enhancements
- Integrate machine learning models using scikit-learn and PyTorch for dynamic adjustments in genre agents.
- Utilize Together AI API for advanced AI capabilities as per openai-reference.yaml.
- Develop training and evaluation pipelines for ML models.

## 4. Testing and Monitoring
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all modules and microservices.
- Implement real-time logging, monitoring dashboards, and alerting systems.
- Ensure log rotation and proper log level management.

## 5. Ethical and Privacy Compliance
- Implement data anonymization and ensure compliance with GDPR and CCPA.
- Maintain transparency in dynamic difficulty and monetization adjustments.
- Regularly review and audit data handling and AI decision processes.

## 6. Documentation and Deployment
- Document APIs, data schemas, and AI agent workflows.
- Prepare deployment scripts and CI/CD pipelines.
- Plan for scalability and future feature integration.
